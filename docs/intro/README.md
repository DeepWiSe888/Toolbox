# RF sensor introduction

We are very pleased to introduce our RF sensing platform "MetaWiSe" that is a serials tools for exploring RF sensors such as UWB radar, mmWave radar, Wi-Fi, etc offered by AIWiSe. Such RF signals can be applied in many scnerios such as smart city IoT, robot navigation, remote vital signs monitoring, etc. This document is a background introduction of RF sensing technologies, and their development boards. To establish RF sensing theory knowledge will give you a right way to use our RF sensors in your project or product.
